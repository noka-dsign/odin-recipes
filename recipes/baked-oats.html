<p>These protein baked oats are such a simple way to pack in a ton of nutrient into your breakfast. They’re loaded with protein (of course) with almost 20 grams per serving, lots of fiber and healthy fats.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oats</li>
        <li>Protein Powder</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Maple Syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Add all ingredients aside from the oats and mix ins (chocolate chips, blueberries etc) to a blender. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add in the oats and pulse to combine. I personally don't like the oats fully blended into the mixture, but you can do this if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a small baking dish and fold in your desired mix ins.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
        <li>I like to top the chocolate chip version with banana and flakey salt, the blueberry with chopped walnuts and honey and the strawberry with more fresh strawberries and yogurt.</li>
    </ol>
