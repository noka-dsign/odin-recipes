<p>This comforting lasagna layers tender roasted vegetables with a velvety 
    tomato-onion masala, gently perfumed with ginger, garlic, garam masala, 
    and a hint of chili heat. Creamy béchamel and soft ribbons of pasta 
    balance the spices, creating a dish that's rich, subtly spicy, and irresistibly 
    cozy, an East-meets-Italy twist perfect for slow evenings and shared tables.</p>
